# Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing
In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

The project is an analysis of the correlation between handwashing and the number of deaths and how has it been reduced drastically.
